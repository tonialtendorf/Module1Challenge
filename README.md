# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon Social Solutions, Inc>

## Description

The challenge was to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards to the already created Horiseon website.


## Installation

NA

## Usage

The website now meets accessibility standards by using semantic HTML elements, adding alt text to the images, and putting each heading attribute in sequential order.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/headerscreenshot.jpg)
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot2.jpg)
